# You need to ensure that the unit test will pass

You are developing a class named Scorecard. The following code implements the Scorecard
class. (Line numbers are included for reference only.)

```csharp
01 public class Scorecard
02 {
03  private Dictionary<string, int> players = new Dictionary<string, int>();
04  public void Add(string name, int score)
05  {
06      players.Add(name, score);
07  }
08
09 }
```

You create the following unit test method to test the Scorecard class implementation:

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void UnitTest1()
{
    Scorecard scorecard = new Scorecard();
    scorecard.Add("Player1", 10);
    scorecard.Add("Player2", 15);
    int expectedScore = 15;
    int actualScore = scorecard["Player2"];
    Assert.AreEqual(expectedScore, actualScore];
}
```

You need to ensure that the unit test will pass.
What should you do?

A. Insert the following code segment at line 08:

```csharp
public int this[string name]
{
    get
    {
        return players[name];
    }
}
```

B. Insert the following code segment at line 08:

```csharp
public Dictionary Players
{
    get
    {
        return players;
    }
}

```
C. Replace line 03 with the following code segment:

```csharp
public Dictionary();
```

D. Insert the following code segment at line 08:
```csharp
public int score(string name)
{
    return players[name];
}

```
